        <p>Life is unpredictable, isnâ€™t it? Who would have thought that after spending such a special childhood together, weâ€™d suddenly go our separate ways, not meeting for ten whole years?</p>
        <p>I still remember the times when we were inseparable, sharing laughs, stories, and little moments that made our bond so special. But then, life took us on different paths. I changed schools, and as time passed, the distance grew. Days turned into months, months into years, and eventually, a whole decade went by.</p>
        <p>For ten long years, we didnâ€™t meet, didnâ€™t talk, and had no idea what was happening in each otherâ€™s lives. But deep down, the memories never faded. You were always a special part of my childhood, a bond that was never truly lostâ€”just paused by time.</p>
        <p>Then, on 21 May 2023, at exactly 7:09 PM, something changed. I decided to send you a simple messageâ€”â€˜Hi Kittu Didi.â€™ At that moment, I had no idea what would happen next. Would you remember me? Would we still have that same bond? But what followed was nothing short of magical. In just two years, you have become one of the most important people in my life. Itâ€™s funny how one message can bring back a person who was always meant to stay.</p>
        <p>Now, looking back, I realize how lucky I am to have you in my life again. Youâ€™re not just a friendâ€”youâ€™re my bestest friend, my family, my constant source of joy and support. From our endless conversations to the moments where we just understand each other without even saying much, everything about our friendship feels special.</p>
        <p>I donâ€™t know what the future holds, but thereâ€™s one thing Iâ€™m sure ofâ€”I want you in my life forever. No more gaps, no more lost time, just an unbreakable bond that will always remain strong. Some friendships are rare, and ours is one of them.</p>
        <p>So, hereâ€™s to usâ€”to our journey, to our crazy conversations, to our laughter, to all the moments weâ€™ve shared, and to the countless memories we are yet to make.</p>
        <p>Thank you for being you. Thank you for being my bestest friend.</p>
        <p>With all my heart,</p>
        <p><strong>Your BBGðŸŽ€</strong></p>
        <p>ðŸ’•</p>
